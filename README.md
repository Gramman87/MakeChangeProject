# Make Change Project

## Description
Simple program to take user input, item costs and money tendered and, provide user with the change amount and pieces of money needed to provide the appropriate change.
## What I learned:
This is the first project I have completed and submitted for grade at Skill Distillery. In creation of this program I: created a rudimentary UI, created and called methods, used the Scanner to take user input to navigate the menu and establish values for certain variables, developed logic and used casting to separate whole dollars from change.

I had written some very small programs in Java prior to this but, this is by far the biggest ground up project I have completed to date. I have been very excited to start this next adventure in life and it showed in my approach to this program. I jumped straight into hammering out lines of code with little planning. Luckily it is not a super complicated program and my use of methods made it easy to reorganize and refactor my program as needed. The largest hurdle I encountered in this development was the writing the syntax for separating the change into each denomination. Although the logic on how to accomplish this came easy, my first crack at writing it into Java was NOT clean, concise, or optimal. I stuck with it and continued to write and re-write these sections until I was confident the approach was clear, concise, and functional. I have been coding almost two months and have already come to the understanding that rigidly committing to a single approach can be the cause of so much struggle. Being flexible and continuing to explore different paths to your goal is crucial for moral and success.
